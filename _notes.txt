basically a record filter.  keep it simple for now.
assume a record is a json object with simple prop:val pairs.
For each prop, build a list of toggle buttons.  Select one (or multiple)
then automatically update record list display to reflect the 
currently selected property value(s).

think R11/R13/... insulation.
